Icarus includes a new variant called Cyberpunk starting from version 3.0.0.
The theme is inspired by the video game [Cyberpunk 2077](https://www.cyberpunk.net/us/en/) 
developed by CD PROJEKT RED.
This variant aims at providing a different Icarus experience to these who like dark-themed
blogs.
It should be noted that it uses recent web styling features that are not working correctly  
in some legacy browsers, including Internet Explorer and legacy Microsoft Edge.

To enable the Cyberpunk theme, open `_config.icarus.yml` and make the following change:

{% codeblock _config.icarus.yml lang:diff %}
- variant: default
+ variant: cyberpunk
{% endcodeblock %}

You may also want to change the theme of highlighted code blocks.
In that case, you can find some dark highlight.js themes 
[here](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/tree/master/src/styles).
Copy the file name, excluding the `.css` extension, and put it in the `article.highlight.theme`
option in `_config.icarus.yml`.
For example, if you want to change the theme to `xt256`, make the following change:

{% codeblock _config.icarus.yml lang:diff %}
# Article related configurations
article:
    highlight:
-         theme: atom-one-light
+         theme: xt256
{% endcodeblock %}

Apart from the color palette, Icarus also used two image resources that are placed on the top 
navigation bar and bottom page footer from the official Cyberpunk 2077 website.
If you wish to make further modifications to this theme variant, you can take a look at
`<icarus_directory>/source/css/cyberpunk.styl`.
